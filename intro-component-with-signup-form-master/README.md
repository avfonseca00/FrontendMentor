## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to validate forms using Vanilla JavaScript and also to use regular expressions to validate email fields. In the code below you can see a bit of the code where the email is validated using test function to validate regular expressions:   

```js
function validateEmail(email) {  
    const emailPattern = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/; // Patr√≥n del email  
    return emailPattern.test(email);  //Si se cumple el patron se devuelve true
}  
```
